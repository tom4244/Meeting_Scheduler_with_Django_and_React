The following is a description of postgreSQL tables used in the project.

The "auth_user" and "auth_group" tables are generated by Django. Three other tables must be created: "person", "session", and "session_entry". "person" contains additional information not in "auth_user", the "mtg_types" field. "session" contains meetings that have been registered by users and additional meetings on a repeating schedule calculated according to users' instructions for meeting days and number of weeks. "session_entry" contains users' instructions for first meeting day, meeting days of the week, and number of weeks in one concise phrase. 

"person" table example:

 id | auth_user_id | username |          created_at           |          updated_at           |      mtg_types
